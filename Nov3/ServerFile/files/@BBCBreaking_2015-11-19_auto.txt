damn ... is this how it'll start ? 
heyy !! shit is about to hit the fan and the whole world seems to be sitting under it .. 
and here is the difference in leadership 
france at war ... 👎⚠🆘😤 
3rd time since 1848 that a french president gathers both houses of parliament . this is serious ! 
some degree of irony here . 
hasn't it planned ? france wants to attacks syria , but they should have the ' reason ' to do it that make world agree 
looks like france have pretty much declared war ! 
dark days ahead ... 
so it begins 
meanwhile , back in the us ..... 
aw fuck i think france has declared war ... this isn't going to end well ... 
we support you 
well , here we go ........... 
go hollande go ... go wash your sins in blood . 
meanwhile some real speech on the crisis as opposed to hearing obama's silly dither . 
we are now seeing world war three god help us 
we are all at war with terrorism , or we will be victims . 
updates : 
eerily reminds me of chamberlain's speech to britain about going to war with germany . please , not ww3 . 😢 
yikes . bold rhetoric . 
fucking terrorists . 
different tenor in obama's and hollande's statements ?
