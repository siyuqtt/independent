chicago police officer had history of complaints 
disgusting . the cop who murdered had history of complaints 
i'll sit here and act all surprised that the cop who gunned down laquan mcdonald had a long history of complaints . 
why is it that a bad cop's record doesn't come into question until he/she kills ? 
chicago cop's checkered past 
this cop is a jerk and his attorney is even a bigger one . why was he the only one that fired upon the victim ?... 
shocking no one , the criminal who murdered a child in chicago had committing crimes and escalating for years . 
a history of complaints 
why we need real accountability : who executed 20 prior complaints & 2 lawsuits 
had history of complaints before laquan mcdonald shooting 
cop's attorney justifies excessive gun use/killing ' cuz no taser was available . 
didn't expect to see a white c.p.o. murder a black man as soon as i was done writing my book makes me want to vomit 
faced many complaints before death . by 
at least 20 complaints filed against officer who killed group finds -- none resulted in discipline 
abusive cops almost always exhibit warning signs , but keep their jobs anyway . 
killer cops that are always cleared indicates a culture of evil . you cannot trust in that environment . 
holy smokes , this jason van dyke guy is a reeeeeal shithead .
