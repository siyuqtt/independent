enough with the french flag facebook logo 
opinion : enough with french flag facebook logo - 
over trivializing the french tri-colour . stop it 
if you’re an american w/ a facebook french profile pic , wow , what a true patriot ! now , on to cat videos . harsh ? 
enough with the french flag logo 
i can't disagree with this . also , no one changed to russia or beirut's flag ... " enough with the french flag fb logo " 
" an american with a french facebook flag demeans the war on terror and is as effective as a smiley face . " 
why you shouldn't tri color your social media profile pictures 
another core component of american and french democracy is freedom of expression | 
interesting read . 
opinion : drop that facebook logo 
why your tricolor support doesn't mean shit . 
american leadership needs to translate the requirements for the war on terror from symbols to tangible action . 
james mulvaney doesn't agree with your profile pics , you guys , so , you know , better switch them back now . 
i couldn't agree more . people need to actually help , not just bandwagon on social media . 
" i am not going to tricolor my face " : james mulvaney writes that the logo trivializes the war on terror 
i'm keeping my tricolor facebook ! you can shove it and go back to your " careless " life ! 
retweet if yoiu agree , enough with the french flag facebook profile pics link : 
agreed . proves again why it's a mistake to expect deep thoughts from anyone on facebook . 
i totally agree ! 
wtf is this guys problem , tell me what you think ... 
in case you didn't have enough poutrage in your daily diet . 
where was james mulvaney's call to bring down facebook backgrounds during the rainbow gay marriage days ? 
i only changed my picture because it was at the very least what i could do to show support . will i keep it like ...
