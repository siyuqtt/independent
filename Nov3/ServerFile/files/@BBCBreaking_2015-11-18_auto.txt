i just can't . i'm so scared for the world 😨 
france is at war 
he needs to wake up obama with that message !!! 
shades of gwb post 9/11 . but we need a steady cool hand 
unfortunately for the dead . that woke you up froggy . 
" eye for an eye " ? 
great . just what we need ! 
some moral clarity here ... from the french president 
declaration of war from france . 
if i were a frenchman i'd be very proud of my politicians - the entire french parliament sings the 
powerful stuff from hollande 
this was their intent people . excuses for more war . could it be any more clear ? 
shit ! 
fuck isis 
this is a lot like post 9/11 rhetoric ......... did we not learn anything 
president called for a u.n. security council meeting . 
war on terror 
because the good response to death is more death . obviously . 
rt we average person need peace ! 
damn ... is this how it'll start ? 
heyy !! shit is about to hit the fan and the whole world seems to be sitting under it .. 
and here is the difference in leadership 
france at war ... 👎⚠🆘😤 
3rd time since 1848 that a french president gathers both houses of parliament . this is serious ! 
some degree of irony here . 
hasn't it planned ? france wants to attacks syria , but they should have the ' reason ' to do it that make world agree 
looks like france have pretty much declared war ! 
dark days ahead ... 
so it begins 
meanwhile , back in the us ..... 
aw fuck i think france has declared war ... this isn't going to end well ... 
we support you 
well , here we go ........... 
go hollande go ... go wash your sins in blood . 
meanwhile some real speech on the crisis as opposed to hearing obama's silly dither . 
we are now seeing world war three god help us 
we are all at war with terrorism , or we will be victims . 
updates : 
eerily reminds me of chamberlain's speech to britain about going to war with germany . please , not ww3 . 😢 
yikes . bold rhetoric . 
fucking terrorists . 
different tenor in obama's and hollande's statements ?

the word for goosebumps is chair de poule . 
i just can't . i'm so scared for the world 😨 
france is at war 
he needs to wake up obama with that message !!! 
shades of gwb post 9/11 . but we need a steady cool hand 
unfortunately for the dead . that woke you up froggy . 
" eye for an eye " ? 
great . just what we need ! 
some moral clarity here ... from the french president 
declaration of war from france . 
if i were a frenchman i'd be very proud of my politicians - the entire french parliament sings the 
powerful stuff from hollande 
this was their intent people . excuses for more war . could it be any more clear ? 
shit ! 
fuck isis 
this is a lot like post 9/11 rhetoric ......... did we not learn anything 
president called for a u.n. security council meeting . 
war on terror 
because the good response to death is more death . obviously . 
rt we average person need peace ! 
damn ... is this how it'll start ? 
heyy !! shit is about to hit the fan and the whole world seems to be sitting under it .. 
and here is the difference in leadership 
france at war ... 👎⚠🆘😤 
3rd time since 1848 that a french president gathers both houses of parliament . this is serious ! 
some degree of irony here . 
hasn't it planned ? france wants to attacks syria , but they should have the ' reason ' to do it that make world agree 
looks like france have pretty much declared war ! 
dark days ahead ... 
so it begins 
meanwhile , back in the us ..... 
aw fuck i think france has declared war ... this isn't going to end well ... 
we support you 
well , here we go ........... 
go hollande go ... go wash your sins in blood . 
meanwhile some real speech on the crisis as opposed to hearing obama's silly dither . 
we are now seeing world war three god help us 
we are all at war with terrorism , or we will be victims . 
updates : 
eerily reminds me of chamberlain's speech to britain about going to war with germany . please , not ww3 . 😢 
yikes . bold rhetoric . 
fucking terrorists . 
different tenor in obama's and hollande's statements ?

the word for goosebumps is chair de poule . 
i just can't . i'm so scared for the world 😨 
france is at war 
he needs to wake up obama with that message !!! 
shades of gwb post 9/11 . but we need a steady cool hand 
unfortunately for the dead . that woke you up froggy . 
" eye for an eye " ? 
great . just what we need ! 
some moral clarity here ... from the french president 
declaration of war from france . 
if i were a frenchman i'd be very proud of my politicians - the entire french parliament sings the 
powerful stuff from hollande 
this was their intent people . excuses for more war . could it be any more clear ? 
shit ! 
fuck isis 
this is a lot like post 9/11 rhetoric ......... did we not learn anything 
president called for a u.n. security council meeting . 
war on terror 
because the good response to death is more death . obviously . 
rt we average person need peace ! 
damn ... is this how it'll start ? 
heyy !! shit is about to hit the fan and the whole world seems to be sitting under it .. 
and here is the difference in leadership 
france at war ... 👎⚠🆘😤 
3rd time since 1848 that a french president gathers both houses of parliament . this is serious ! 
some degree of irony here . 
hasn't it planned ? france wants to attacks syria , but they should have the ' reason ' to do it that make world agree 
looks like france have pretty much declared war ! 
dark days ahead ... 
so it begins 
meanwhile , back in the us ..... 
aw fuck i think france has declared war ... this isn't going to end well ... 
we support you 
well , here we go ........... 
go hollande go ... go wash your sins in blood . 
meanwhile some real speech on the crisis as opposed to hearing obama's silly dither . 
we are now seeing world war three god help us 
we are all at war with terrorism , or we will be victims . 
updates : 
eerily reminds me of chamberlain's speech to britain about going to war with germany . please , not ww3 . 😢 
yikes . bold rhetoric . 
fucking terrorists . 
different tenor in obama's and hollande's statements ?

the word for goosebumps is chair de poule . 
i just can't . i'm so scared for the world 😨 
france is at war 
he needs to wake up obama with that message !!! 
shades of gwb post 9/11 . but we need a steady cool hand 
unfortunately for the dead . that woke you up froggy . 
" eye for an eye " ? 
great . just what we need ! 
some moral clarity here ... from the french president 
declaration of war from france . 
if i were a frenchman i'd be very proud of my politicians - the entire french parliament sings the 
powerful stuff from hollande 
this was their intent people . excuses for more war . could it be any more clear ? 
shit ! 
fuck isis 
this is a lot like post 9/11 rhetoric ......... did we not learn anything 
president called for a u.n. security council meeting . 
war on terror 
because the good response to death is more death . obviously . 
rt we average person need peace ! 
damn ... is this how it'll start ? 
heyy !! shit is about to hit the fan and the whole world seems to be sitting under it .. 
and here is the difference in leadership 
france at war ... 👎⚠🆘😤 
3rd time since 1848 that a french president gathers both houses of parliament . this is serious ! 
some degree of irony here . 
hasn't it planned ? france wants to attacks syria , but they should have the ' reason ' to do it that make world agree 
looks like france have pretty much declared war ! 
dark days ahead ... 
so it begins 
meanwhile , back in the us ..... 
aw fuck i think france has declared war ... this isn't going to end well ... 
we support you 
well , here we go ........... 
go hollande go ... go wash your sins in blood . 
meanwhile some real speech on the crisis as opposed to hearing obama's silly dither . 
we are now seeing world war three god help us 
we are all at war with terrorism , or we will be victims . 
updates : 
eerily reminds me of chamberlain's speech to britain about going to war with germany . please , not ww3 . 😢 
yikes . bold rhetoric . 
fucking terrorists . 
different tenor in obama's and hollande's statements ?

i just can't . i'm so scared for the world 😨 
france is at war 
he needs to wake up obama with that message !!! 
shades of gwb post 9/11 . but we need a steady cool hand 
unfortunately for the dead . that woke you up froggy . 
" eye for an eye " ? 
great . just what we need ! 
some moral clarity here ... from the french president 
declaration of war from france . 
if i were a frenchman i'd be very proud of my politicians - the entire french parliament sings the 
powerful stuff from hollande 
this was their intent people . excuses for more war . could it be any more clear ? 
shit ! 
fuck isis 
this is a lot like post 9/11 rhetoric ......... did we not learn anything 
president called for a u.n. security council meeting . 
war on terror 
because the good response to death is more death . obviously . 
rt we average person need peace ! 
damn ... is this how it'll start ? 
heyy !! shit is about to hit the fan and the whole world seems to be sitting under it .. 
and here is the difference in leadership 
france at war ... 👎⚠🆘😤 
3rd time since 1848 that a french president gathers both houses of parliament . this is serious ! 
some degree of irony here . 
hasn't it planned ? france wants to attacks syria , but they should have the ' reason ' to do it that make world agree 
looks like france have pretty much declared war ! 
dark days ahead ... 
so it begins 
meanwhile , back in the us ..... 
aw fuck i think france has declared war ... this isn't going to end well ... 
we support you 
well , here we go ........... 
go hollande go ... go wash your sins in blood . 
meanwhile some real speech on the crisis as opposed to hearing obama's silly dither . 
we are now seeing world war three god help us 
we are all at war with terrorism , or we will be victims . 
updates : 
eerily reminds me of chamberlain's speech to britain about going to war with germany . please , not ww3 . 😢 
yikes . bold rhetoric . 
fucking terrorists . 
different tenor in obama's and hollande's statements ?

unfortunately for the dead . that woke you up froggy . 
" eye for an eye " ? 
great . just what we need ! 
some moral clarity here ... from the french president 
declaration of war from france . 
if i were a frenchman i'd be very proud of my politicians - the entire french parliament sings the 
powerful stuff from hollande 
this was their intent people . excuses for more war . could it be any more clear ? 
shit !

the word for goosebumps is chair de poule . 
i just can't . i'm so scared for the world 😨 
france is at war 
he needs to wake up obama with that message !!! 
shades of gwb post 9/11 . but we need a steady cool hand 
unfortunately for the dead . that woke you up froggy . 
" eye for an eye " ? 
great . just what we need ! 
some moral clarity here ... from the french president 
declaration of war from france . 
if i were a frenchman i'd be very proud of my politicians - the entire french parliament sings the 
powerful stuff from hollande 
this was their intent people . excuses for more war . could it be any more clear ? 
shit ! 
fuck isis 
this is a lot like post 9/11 rhetoric ......... did we not learn anything 
president called for a u.n. security council meeting . 
war on terror 
because the good response to death is more death . obviously . 
rt we average person need peace ! 
damn ... is this how it'll start ? 
heyy !! shit is about to hit the fan and the whole world seems to be sitting under it .. 
and here is the difference in leadership 
france at war ... 👎⚠🆘😤 
3rd time since 1848 that a french president gathers both houses of parliament . this is serious ! 
some degree of irony here . 
hasn't it planned ? france wants to attacks syria , but they should have the ' reason ' to do it that make world agree 
looks like france have pretty much declared war ! 
dark days ahead ... 
so it begins 
meanwhile , back in the us ..... 
aw fuck i think france has declared war ... this isn't going to end well ... 
we support you 
well , here we go ........... 
go hollande go ... go wash your sins in blood . 
meanwhile some real speech on the crisis as opposed to hearing obama's silly dither . 
we are now seeing world war three god help us 
we are all at war with terrorism , or we will be victims . 
updates : 
eerily reminds me of chamberlain's speech to britain about going to war with germany . please , not ww3 . 😢 
yikes . bold rhetoric . 
fucking terrorists . 
different tenor in obama's and hollande's statements ?

he needs to wake up obama with that message !!! 
shades of gwb post 9/11 . but we need a steady cool hand 
unfortunately for the dead . that woke you up froggy . 
" eye for an eye " ? 
great . just what we need ! 
some moral clarity here ... from the french president 
declaration of war from france . 
if i were a frenchman i'd be very proud of my politicians - the entire french parliament sings the 
powerful stuff from hollande 
this was their intent people . excuses for more war . could it be any more clear ? 
shit ! 
fuck isis 
this is a lot like post 9/11 rhetoric ......... did we not learn anything 
president called for a u.n. security council meeting . 
war on terror 
because the good response to death is more death . obviously . 
rt we average person need peace ! 
damn ... is this how it'll start ? 
heyy !! shit is about to hit the fan and the whole world seems to be sitting under it .. 
and here is the difference in leadership 
france at war ... 👎⚠🆘😤 
3rd time since 1848 that a french president gathers both houses of parliament . this is serious ! 
some degree of irony here . 
hasn't it planned ? france wants to attacks syria , but they should have the ' reason ' to do it that make world agree 
looks like france have pretty much declared war ! 
dark days ahead ... 
so it begins 
meanwhile , back in the us ..... 
aw fuck i think france has declared war ... this isn't going to end well ... 
we support you 
well , here we go ........... 
go hollande go ... go wash your sins in blood . 
meanwhile some real speech on the crisis as opposed to hearing obama's silly dither . 
we are now seeing world war three god help us 
we are all at war with terrorism , or we will be victims . 
updates : 
eerily reminds me of chamberlain's speech to britain about going to war with germany . please , not ww3 . 😢 
yikes . bold rhetoric . 
fucking terrorists . 
different tenor in obama's and hollande's statements ?

he needs to wake up obama with that message !!! 
shades of gwb post 9/11 . but we need a steady cool hand 
unfortunately for the dead . that woke you up froggy . 
" eye for an eye " ? 
great . just what we need ! 
some moral clarity here ... from the french president 
declaration of war from france . 
if i were a frenchman i'd be very proud of my politicians - the entire french parliament sings the 
powerful stuff from hollande 
this was their intent people . excuses for more war . could it be any more clear ? 
shit ! 
fuck isis 
this is a lot like post 9/11 rhetoric ......... did we not learn anything 
president called for a u.n. security council meeting . 
war on terror 
because the good response to death is more death . obviously .

and here is the difference in leadership 
france at war ... 👎⚠🆘😤 
3rd time since 1848 that a french president gathers both houses of parliament . this is serious ! 
some degree of irony here . 
hasn't it planned ? france wants to attacks syria , but they should have the ' reason ' to do it that make world agree 
looks like france have pretty much declared war ! 
dark days ahead ...

we support you 
well , here we go ...........
