fuck isis 
this is a lot like post 9/11 rhetoric ......... did we not learn anything 
president called for a u.n. security council meeting . 
war on terror 
because the good response to death is more death . obviously . 
rt we average person need peace ! 
damn ... is this how it'll start ? 
shit ! 
and here is the difference in leadership 
france at war ... ðŸ‘Žâš ðŸ†˜ðŸ˜¤ 
3rd time since 1848 that a french president gathers both houses of parliament . this is serious ! 
some degree of irony here . 
hasn't it planned ? france wants to attacks syria , but they should have the ' reason ' to do it that make world agree 
looks like france have pretty much declared war ! 
dark days ahead ... 
so it begins 
meanwhile , back in the us ..... 
aw fuck i think france has declared war ... this isn't going to end well ... 
we support you 
well , here we go ........... 
go hollande go ... go wash your sins in blood . 
meanwhile some real speech on the crisis as opposed to hearing obama's silly dither . 
we are now seeing world war three god help us 
we are all at war with terrorism , or we will be victims . 
updates : 
" eye for an eye " ? 
eerily reminds me of chamberlain's speech to britain about going to war with germany . please , not ww3 . ðŸ˜¢ 
yikes . bold rhetoric . 
fucking terrorists . 
different tenor in obama's and hollande's statements ? 
some moral clarity here ... from the french president
