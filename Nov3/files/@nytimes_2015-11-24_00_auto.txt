a hated phrase that subway riders are hearing more : ‘ sick passenger ’ 
the ' sick passenger ' is the urban bigfoot 
can't always blame people for being sick . mta should better inform passengers what to do when they're feeling ill 
i was once sick on a train . but the conductor just put me off in mineola and pointed to a hospital . 
" a voice over the intercom delivers the bad news ... your train is delayed because of a sick passenger . " 
a hated phrase that riders are hearing more : ‘ sick passenger ’ 
on the subway , one rider's illness is many riders ' delay . ' there has to be a better way to handle it . ' 
somehow the ny times avoids asking why people feel it necessary to ride the subway while sick . sick leave , anyone ? 
a hated phrase that nyc subway passengers are hearing w/ increased frequency : ‘ sick passenger ’ 
this is the result of nyers not being more proactive and team-oriented in carrying sick people off everyone suffers
