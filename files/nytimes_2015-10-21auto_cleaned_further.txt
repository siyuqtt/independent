why i don't play dfs : no restrictions on multi-entries . " 91% of profits earned by 1.3% of players . "
draft kings/fan duel need to be shutdown . matthew berry/espn are acting as shills for this fraud . @matthewberrytmr
91 percent of daily fantasy sports player profits were won by just 1.3 percent of the players
@bryanallain : i'm not a big conspiracy theorist , but these dfs sites need to clean up their acts .
@wipmorningshow i'd love to hear you cover the fanduel/draft kings scandal . have you seen nytimes ?
their commercials ruin espn nfl countdown ... its definitely gambling & this is what happens when it's unregulated
it's hard to tell if draftkings and fanduel are more like ' boiler room ' or ' wolf of wall street '
online fantasy sites say they want to be transparent but won't answer questions from ny times .
blast from the internet past . the name justine sacco shows up in this article about draftkings , fanduel .
@ncweaver : no regulation ( its " skill " ) , insider information matters , and lots of money ... so of course " fantasy " …
@geneweingarten amused that the grinning and smooth-yet-mischievous guy in this story is named e . haskell

@alanblinder : a georgia prosecutor turned to an anti-gang statute to secure indictments of 15 confederate battle flag backers . …
15 confed flag supporters charged under anti-gang statute . wonder how often that law works against white people ?
they shouldn't have in the 1st place , but comeon ppl-confederate flagsupporters indicted in clash with blackpartygoers
confederate flag supporters arrested ; ( but not farrakhan and other black supremacists calling for murder of whites )
group of confederate-flag wielding white men indicted on gang charges in georgia after exchange with black partygoers
this a perfect example of the confederate flag being used in a negative way . #aas201
