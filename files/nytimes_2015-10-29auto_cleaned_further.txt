editorial : paying for egg donations ( the new york times )
paid egg donation " very existence of these high-end payments suggests the guidelines are something of a sham "
should a woman who donates her ovulated eggs to infertile couples charge free-market prices ? what do pro-lifers say ?
paying a woman more than $ 5,000 or more for her eggs requires “ justification . ” that's opinon not science .
a class action suit coming on compensation for egg donors -- let's open it to free market :
@nytimes editorial board sides with egg donors in price-fixing lawsuit
how much compensation is justified for egg donors ? $8k ? less/more ? who really profits ? <
how much is too much to pay a donor for her eggs ?
editorial supports #eggdonation class action arguing donors be paid more . #fertility
nyt editorial on lawsuit re paying for #eggdonations #ivf
@nytopinion : how much should women be reimbursed for their eggs ?
