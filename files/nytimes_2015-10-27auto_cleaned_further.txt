@alijgreenberg : the exchange rate in venezuela is crazier every day . " few in venezuela want bol√≠vars , but no one can spare a dime " https ‚Ä¶
few in venezuela want bol√≠vars , but no one can spare a dime - just how crazy government price interventions can get
few in venezuela want bol√≠vars , but no one can spare a dime . inflation at 159% $1 = 700bolivars . a crushing economy
few in venezuela want bol√≠vars , but no one can spare a dime . #venezuela , is it time for #bitcoin ? @willybruns
black market rate now at 700 bolivars/$ : few in venezuela want bol√≠vars , but no one can spare a dime

@ninjaeconomics : venezuela's currency so down in the dumps , not even robbers want to steal it h/t @tinssoldier .

" the minimum wage is 7,421 bol√≠vars a month . that is either a decent $ 1,178 a month or a miserable $10.60 " @nytimes
" dinner for two [ ... ] can cost 30,000 bol√≠vars . that is $42.85 at black-market rate or $ 4,762 at the official rate . "
@verambergen : many venezuelans quit their jobs to sell basic goods ( diapers , corn flour ) on black market , tripling their salary https://‚Ä¶
@steve_hanke : #nytimes says there's no est . for #syria's inflation but the troubled currencies project calculations say its 80.78% https ‚Ä¶
#venezuela has lost faith in their currency . 2014 $1 bought ~ 100 bol√≠vars on the black market , now more than 700
: when it comes to forecasting , we know the is the gang that can't shoot straight , just look at . ‚Ä¶
@steve_hanke : #nytimes should start doing its homework and report the most accurate data . #venezuela's inflation is 717% , not 159% http : ‚Ä¶
@steve_hanke : #nytimes exercises sloppy journalism , using #imf's numbers for #venezuela's inflation which are just incorrect ‚Ä¶
@photojournalism : great read on venezuela's ever-deepening economic woes by @willieneuman , @ptorresuribe and @meridithkohut ‚Ä¶
minimum wage in venezuela is about 700bs . either about $1000 or $10 a month .

" dinner for two [ ... ] can cost 30,000 bol√≠vars . that is $42.85 at black-market rate or $ 4,762 at the official rate . "

#venezuela has lost faith in their currency . 2014 $1 bought ~ 100 bol√≠vars on the black market , now more than 700
@steve_hanke : #nytimes should start doing its homework and report the most accurate data . #venezuela's inflation is 717% , not 159% http : ‚Ä¶
@steve_hanke : #nytimes exercises sloppy journalism , using #imf's numbers for #venezuela's inflation which are just incorrect ‚Ä¶

worker honeybees love caffeine just like office workers love caffeine . both get it from plants . ( nyt ):
so , could this be how it came to be known as " getting a buzz on " ?
caffeine improves learning & memory in bees . up to 55% of flowering plants are estimated to have caffeinated nectar
caffeine improves memory & learning in bees , and 55% of flowering plants contain caffeine in nectar .
i guess bees are not that different from humans when it comes to coffee .
interesting article ! thank you for sharing it mace perlman !

bees prefer caffeinated sugar syrup - and some flowers produce caffeine naturally !

few in venezuela want bol√≠vars , but no one can spare a dime - just how crazy government price interventions can get
few in venezuela want bol√≠vars , but no one can spare a dime . inflation at 159% $1 = 700bolivars . a crushing economy
few in venezuela want bol√≠vars , but no one can spare a dime . #venezuela , is it time for #bitcoin ? @willybruns

" the minimum wage is 7,421 bol√≠vars a month . that is either a decent $ 1,178 a month or a miserable $10.60 " @nytimes
" dinner for two [ ... ] can cost 30,000 bol√≠vars . that is $42.85 at black-market rate or $ 4,762 at the official rate . "
#venezuela has lost faith in their currency . 2014 $1 bought ~ 100 bol√≠vars on the black market , now more than 700
meanwhile ... in the #socialist paradise of #venezuela the meat freezers are empty
minimum wage in venezuela is about 700bs . either about $1000 or $10 a month .

@dleonhardt : marco rubio now has a clear lead over jeb bush (& everyone else ) in predictions markets : 33% to 23% for nomination . https :/ ‚Ä¶
great example of using multiple metrics to increase robustness of prediction .
nytimes is only reflecting what polling & other historical facts indicate reality check-
" where's marco " rubio leads repugs as odds favorite for gop nom
a breakdown of which presidential candidate is leading in what category : #j2150a
betting markets are leaning more and more towards rubio .
the campaign prediction markets are fascinating :
the race is on !
ignore the hype about carson's iowa polling . i'm still placing my faith in the nyt's dashboard . he's 4th there .
