in an age of big data : feeling > fact , performance > function . and mood boards . @nytimes
the empathy economy is booming , but how can we connect brands with human emotion ?
@augustasupple : " the empathy economy is booming . facts are out , feelings are in . " #business #empathy
branding is (..) not about what something says , or what it means , but how it makes us feel . a brand is a promise
we talk about emotion : the one thing the internet can‚Äôt buy #brandequity #brandstrategy #renommeegroup
" the moodboard : the most quotidian , slightly embarrassing and now ubiquitous design tool . "
