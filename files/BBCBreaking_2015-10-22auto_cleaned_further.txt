balance the books ? it's not a sweet shop , it's a country . what a bonkers notion :
that's jeremy corbyn's labour party . no leadership . no direction and no hope ||
will the ave voter understand the nuance of this or just compound view of labour as fiscally poor ? irresponsible ?
30 #labstain -ing mps help #osborne pass his hypocritical gimmicky #fiscalcharter and his call for #labour disunity .
cant disagree with fiscal stability but this charter is absolute meaningless , driving dangerous cuts too deep & fast
whatever next ? let's wait for more hubris and a rule from george that the nhs must be in surplus ....
george osborne is doing his best to codify behaviour for all future governments , ensuring they can't adapt .
oh hai ! you'll never guess what - i've just dispensed a packet of prawn cocktail crisps
who likes cheese & onion crisps ? ' cos i've just dispensed a packet of them in my drawer
well done george . the majority of the country is fully behind you . let's keep going ...
labour facing rebellion over opposition to government budget rules . disenfranchised labour mps should join tories
very glad to see that labour mps are following corbyn’s lead in voting against party policy
lambeth labour favourite liz kendall was , quite naturally , one of the mps who abstained from voting today .
osborne introduces legislation he previously labelled " vacuous and irrelevant " when it was suggested in 2010 .
i'm getting very tired of how the bbc reports for tories . take it apart now !
tories fuck poor . alien megastructures near cygnus . shitlarks can't sell fish #theapprentice
so a government can change the law to stop future governments inforcing policy ?!?!

sheesh bbc , you shouldn't have comments available on this story : never seen so much sexism and reverse-snobbery .
are you dissatisfied with the £10m fleeced from your ex-husband ? if so , contact the supreme court now !
@mrichardsonlaw : more of this please ! family courts showing some teeth when it comes to dishonesty re : disclosure . #gohil …
pivotal #divorce high court ruling , cases can be re-opened where it is believed assets were hidden from partner
#supremecourt #divorce give honest , full and frank financial disclosure when considering financial aspect of divorce
both alison sharland and varsha gohli were concerned about non-disclosure of their husband’s wealth :
court sends message to divorcing couples emphasising the need to be truthful about their assets #divorce #disclosure
good luck to the ladies , but surely the message must be " men , avoid getting married " .
past divorce deals could be reopened as result of court ruling if either party had hidden assets .
important to give & receive full & frank financial disclosure to avoid a challenge in the future .
the bbc has left comments open for its supreme court divorcees article . results are predictable .

balance the books ? it's not a sweet shop , it's a country . what a bonkers notion :
will the ave voter understand the nuance of this or just compound view of labour as fiscally poor ? irresponsible ?
that's jeremy corbyn's labour party . no leadership . no direction and no hope ||
whatever next ? let's wait for more hubris and a rule from george that the nhs must be in surplus ....
cant disagree with fiscal stability but this charter is absolute meaningless , driving dangerous cuts too deep & fast
30 #labstain -ing mps help #osborne pass his hypocritical gimmicky #fiscalcharter and his call for #labour disunity .
george osborne is doing his best to codify behaviour for all future governments , ensuring they can't adapt .
oh hai ! you'll never guess what - i've just dispensed a packet of prawn cocktail crisps
who likes cheese & onion crisps ? ' cos i've just dispensed a packet of them in my drawer
well done george . the majority of the country is fully behind you . let's keep going ...
lambeth labour favourite liz kendall was , quite naturally , one of the mps who abstained from voting today .
i'm getting very tired of how the bbc reports for tories . take it apart now !
very glad to see that labour mps are following corbyn’s lead in voting against party policy
osborne introduces legislation he previously labelled " vacuous and irrelevant " when it was suggested in 2010 .
labour facing rebellion over opposition to government budget rules . disenfranchised labour mps should join tories
mps approve osborne's spending rules - it obliges them to do fuck all - they can just overturn the law
tories fuck poor . alien megastructures near cygnus . shitlarks can't sell fish #theapprentice
so a government can change the law to stop future governments inforcing policy ?!?!

balance the books ? it's not a sweet shop , it's a country . what a bonkers notion :

30 #labstain -ing mps help #osborne pass his hypocritical gimmicky #fiscalcharter and his call for #labour disunity .
cant disagree with fiscal stability but this charter is absolute meaningless , driving dangerous cuts too deep & fast
whatever next ? let's wait for more hubris and a rule from george that the nhs must be in surplus ....
george osborne is doing his best to codify behaviour for all future governments , ensuring they can't adapt .
oh hai ! you'll never guess what - i've just dispensed a packet of prawn cocktail crisps
who likes cheese & onion crisps ? ' cos i've just dispensed a packet of them in my drawer
well done george . the majority of the country is fully behind you . let's keep going ...
