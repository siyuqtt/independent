blame those who shilled for downtown seattle tunnel instead of better transit & roads for affordability problem . 
opponents of more housing overall & dense development in urban centers are making seattle less affordable . 
much better transit is needed now . bold measures . if family could live in seattle w/out car , would save big $ .
